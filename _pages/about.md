# About Plotagon AB

Plotagon was founded in 2013 with the dream to turn every keyboard into a magical typewriter that converts ideas into videos through the combined power of technology and animation.

Our unique method is a combination of gaming technology + classic film production + old-fashioned screenwriting.

Along the way, these same users have redefined Plotagon and turned it into something much greater than we ever could imagine back in 2014 when we launched the first version of Plotagon.

Today, a global community of citizens including, Influencers, storytellers, teachers, and corporate trainers use Plotagon to tell stories and to educate students, employees, colleagues and the public at large.

We are very proud to be a part of this movement of user generated content.
